Installation Create a Github account (or log on) Install git locally (click here for instructions for RStudio ) and some Markdown editor (see below) For an introduction to Git(hub), please see the version control chapter . Markdown Markdown is a markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different. Every .md (Markdown) file in this repository in fact uses Markdown for formatting! For example, to indicate a second-level header, you type: ## Title of header Advantages of Markdown: It can be used for a lot of things, e.g., for creating html pages It is platform- and operating system independent You can type markdown in any text editor and open .md files with many programs, such as Atom , Zettlr , Rstudio , Typora , online (e.g., Dillinger ) or even in Word ( Writage tool ). See this page for more tools that support Markdown. Markdown resources Markdown guide Cheatsheet More advanced Markdown tricks Contributing step-by-step A. The easy (but not recommended) way fork the repository to your own Github account by clicking the button on the upper right of the repository: Make edits to the files you want to edit in your browser by clicking the pencil at the top right of a file. All editable .md files can be found in the docs folder Write a commit message for your changes and click Commit changes . After having made all the changes you wanted, go to the tab Pull requests > New pull request . Make sure the base repository is eur-synclab/sync-manual master and head repository is your own repository, e.g., DorienHuijser/sync-manual branchinwhichyoumadechanges . Click Create pull request Your pull request will now appear in the eur-synclab repository list of pull requests . If you want, you can assign someone to review your pull request. One of the owners of the repository will review your commits, may request changes and will finally approve the pull request and merge your changes into the eur-synclab/sync-manual master branch. B. The better way fork the repository to your own Github account by clicking the button on the upper right of the repository: Create a new branch in your forked repository which you will use to make changes in (so your master branch will stay\"clean\"): clone your forked repository to your local PC ( using the command-line or Rstudio ) Make local changes. You can open a .md file in the docs folder with multiple text editors such as Typora, Atom, Zettlr, Rstudio, etc.) and, after saving your changes, commit them ( command-line : git commit -a -m \"commit message\" , RStudio . Your changes are now saved locally. Push your commits to your \u201cremote\u201d (online) repository ( using the command-line : git push origin branchname , in Rstudio ) Follow steps 4-7 explained in the Easy way Important: the next time you start working locally, first update your local version of the repository to the most recent version (Command line: git pull upstream [branchname] [be sure to set the upstream repository first], RStudio ). C. The most advanced way Follow the installation steps for mkdocs here Follow steps 1-4 explained in The better way In your prompt , navigate to your repository directory with cd C:/users/username/your/repo/directory and run mkdocs serve . This creates a URL (something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/) which you can open in your internet browser. Here, you can see all changes that you make directly \"live\". Press Cntrl+C to stop this operation. Run mkdocs build . If everything goes correctly, you can now also open the new .html files in the sync-manual/site folder to see what your changes will look like in the browser. These files have to be created in order for the website to work on others' computers. commit your newly built website (html) files, e.g., git commit -A . -m \"Build site\" Follow step 5-7 explained in The better way. Add yourself as a contributor! Go to this Github issue . Type a comment asking the all-contributors bot to add you (use template mentioned in the issue), look for appropriate emojis here . The bot will open a pull request to add you as contributor. After merging with the master branch, your face will appear in the README.md ! Issues and Projects If you would like to see a change that requires more work or input from others before you can start editing yourself, you can open an Issue . There are some great features about Issues: You can assign people to the Issue who should solve it or provide input You can add the issue to a project. In the tab Projects , you can find our Kanban board in which we have made the columns \u201cTo do\u201d, \u201cIn progress\u201d and \u201cDone\u201d. We made this so we have an overview of Issues that still need work and issues that are in progress. You can add labels to an Issue (please do so!) to specify what kind of issue you are writing After the issue has been solved, you can Close it manually. However, if you made a pull request that solves the issue, you can simply comment Closes #issuenr in the pull request.

The SYNC lab is firmly grounded in exciting new perspectives that have emerged from understanding the dynamic development of the adolescent brain. Vision Our vision is that science becomes better when conducted together with societal partners, including youth panels, schools, and co-creation teams. We also strongly believe in interdisciplinary research teams; therefore, we work with researchers from different scientific disciplines, including the social sciences, life sciences, and humanities. Moreover, the Erasmus SYNC lab embraces Open Science through practices such as pre-registration, data sharing and open-access publishing. Together, we hope we can work on providing the scientific building blocks needed to help shape a better future for the current and next generation of youth.

Also, most of us probably do not want people who aren't involved in your project to have access to our data without our knowledge. In order to deal with the sensitivity of the data and prevent them from being stolen, it is imperative that we ensure the highest possible data security. This document contains some tips to maximize data security. By following these tips, you can be more confident that your participants\u2019 privacy will be guarded and the university will not get sued :smile: Loss of data or other problems? Always report a data breach to the Servicedesk: servicedesk@eur.nl (phone +31 (0)10 408 8880), click here for more information . General data security principles Always report a (possible) data leak/breach Every loss of data is a potential data leak, such as: stolen or lost digital files: USBs, laptops, external hard drives, data that is not backed-up, etc. stolen or lost printed personal data, e.g, a note containing a password, lists with grades, etc. viruses on your PC or hacked accounts, including phishing mails both pseudonymized and anonymized data need to be reported Contact your supervisor and Servicedesk (servicedesk@eur.nl) Report the (possible) leak as soon as possible, so that we can adequately respond and limit the amount of damage for participants as much as possible. Keep in mind that measures taken are meant to secure the data, not to punish those involved! Anonymize your data The best way to guard the privacy of your participants is to anonymize your data, so that the data cannot be traced back to participants (not even with a key containing the name-number links). For longitudinal data, this can get complicated, since you want to be able to link the data of the same subject and may also need the participants\u2019 contact info for next waves. Choose safe passwords for your devices This concerns your EUR account, your laptop, your phone (if it has email on it), and all other devices that contain data. Use a sentence instead of a word: they are harder to crack and easier to remember (especially when they are long and contain letters, numbers and signs). Use a password manager to keep all your passwords safe, such as Lastpass . Read more about Lastpass Lastpass is a password manager that can store all your passwords safely in the cloud. You have to think of a master password - a very strong password - only once. As soon as you log in using that password, you have access to all passwords that you saved in your vault. With Lastpass you can ( all features ): Create safe passwords (no creativity required from your end) Never again have to remember passwords for all of your accounts by heart Store your passwords safely Autofill passwords on websites so that signing on will be a breeze Share passwords with others (free version: share with 1 person) Save secure notes and other details as well You can either install lastpass on your PC (or download the mobile app) or install an extension in your browser. Get started More information here User manual If possible, change your passwords or codes (e.g., to lockers) regularly Share passwords only with the people who really need it Protect mobile devices: Use a safe internet network (preferably Eduroam): never use an open network. Preferably use EduVPN , which is free for university employees and makes sure that the connection is safe. Make sure you can wipe the device and change the password(s) from a distance in case of theft or loss Make sure to have a copy of the information on the university system Always install all security updates and, if possible, antivirus and anti-malware software Do not install jailbreak/root (gaining privileged access to the operating system) Do not save confidential information, unless it is well-protected Protect files with passwords too If a file contains personal data, such as contact information, the link to a participant number or data on the MRI checklist, protect it with a password: In Word and Excel: File > Info > Protect document/Workbook structure > Encrypt with password. You can also restrict editing via these options. Save the password somewhere safe so that you can always access the document: if you lose the password, you cannot access the document anymore. Only give the password to those who really need it. Try to restrict the amount of people that have access to the document. Keep paper data (logs, questionnaires, MRI checklists) locked up Do not leave data behind in labs after testing: take them with you! When testing multiple participants in one day, do not leave data from a previous participant laying around Keep papers in a locked closet or a locker and only give access to people that need it If necessary, keep a record of who has access Do not take papers with such data home or outside, unless strictly necessary Keep a clear-desk policy Do not leave any data unattended if you leave your desk for a longer period of time. For digital data: lock your screen (Cntrl+Alt+Delete > Enter or: Windows+L) For paper data: put them in a closed closet or locker or lock your room if no one else is present When testing participants, do not leave data from a previous participant laying around and take them with you when you leave This includes all desks: your own workspace, the secretariat, computer room, the lab, etc. Email safely When emailing large amounts of people (e.g., all your participants for a project newsletter), put the email addresses in the BCC (blind carbon copy) field, so that the receivers cannot see who else got the email. Put your own email address in the \u201cTo\u201d field. Where possible, use your university email, which has a safe connection with the university servers. Avoid using Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo. Never send research data via email (except when encrypted or using tools like SURF filesender). Print safely Use Secure printing to print confidential information via a password: The printer will only start printing when you have filled in a personal pin code. Securely printed documents will be erased from the university servers immediately after printing. The settings of the print job cannot be adjusted at the printer When throwing away confidential information on paper, use a container that can be locked (especially made for confidential paper). Storing your data Aim not to store data on local drives Use the Research Drive, which is automatically backed-up and secured through the university. If you are processing data on your local Data drive, be sure to back it up at the Research Drive. Don\u2019t use personal accounts to store data long-term: if you leave the university suddenly, your data will not be accessible for others! Do not store identifiable information on personal devices It is only permitted to work with sensitive data when this is necessary for data collection, processing or planning and, officially, only when participants have given their permission. If you do work with sensitive data on a personal computer (e.g., laptop), remove the data after the analyses. Do not store non-anonymized data in the cloud Never save documents online, just open them. You never know who will get their hands on your data when you store it in the cloud. If you want to work at home, use Owncloud to interact with the Research Drive data Or use Remote desktop: gives access to your university desktop, see this link for a manual Or use SURFdrive , a safe alternative to Google Drive that everyone with a (Dutch) university account has access to (500 GB of personal storage) N.B. You can request SURFdrive also for students or give students the link If using a local drive, laptop, USB, external hard drive, or video camera, the following rules apply: If you are processing data on your local drive, be sure to always back it up on the Research Drive If possible, protect the device, hard drive or drive with a password Do not put the passwords to laptops on the laptop itself When the data have been saved at the right location, delete the data from the device (shift + delete or empty the recycling bin) If you have to take devices onto the street, bring them to a (safe and appointed) university location as quickly as possible. Do not bring them home unless absolutely necessary. If you have to take data home, do let leave them unattended in a (semi)public place (such as a car or library). If possible, leave it in a locked room. Communication and sharing Do not share data via email attachments, Google Drive, etc. Instead of email attachments, use SURF filesender . Email attachments are saved on mail servers and on your PC, whereas this is not the case with filesender. If you are sending an internal email, use a hyperlink or the path to the relevant folder where possible If you want others to be able to edit the documents you share, use SURFdrive or share only the relevant files via Research Drive. Be sure the data shared are anonymous. Do not talk about or analyze individual data in public spaces For example in the elevator, a common room, public transport, social media, emails, etc. Coding videos and audio is only allowed where other researchers from the same project work or in special coding rooms Coding audio in a public space is only allowed when others cannot hear the audio, e.g., because you are wearing headphones Transcribe audio and video using safe websites such as uitgetypt.nl Contacting participants outside the university When contacting participants outside the university, e.g., via your own mobile phone, make sure not to send any identifiable information via your phone (incl. sms or whatsapp) Avoid coupling participant numbers with phone numbers and/or names in emails or whatsapp messages","title":"Data security protocol"},{"location":"data-management/data-security.html#data-security-protocol","text":"We researchers deal with a lot of data: task data, questionnaire data, MRI or EEG data, but also contact information, health information, etc. Most of these data are highly sensitive, in that the risk of identification is high.

Folders A project folder (at the root of the Research Drive) has to be created by the contract administrator (currently: Mark). This means that each project is created under the contract. Information needed includes: the name of the folder (preferably Year_ProjectName, e.g., \"2018_Brainlinks\" the data steward of the project folder the amount of storage needed (can be changed later) Storage : our contract, \u201cESSB Brain and Development\u201d, currently has 16 TB of storage capacity which is divided among the existing project folders. More storage capacity has to be requested with Research Data Management/Jeroen Rombouts (who in turn requests this at SURF) by the contract administrator 2. Requesting and providing access Requesting access (users) Request access to a folder with the data steward of the relevant project. You can find who is the data steward for which project in the file \u201c ResearchDrive_overview_Projects_Access_Groups \u201d . Giving access (data stewards) Select the folder and click the sharing icon. In the area that appears, you can add individual users or groups and alternatively, create sharing links (URLs) with non-Research Drive users. Giving access to a folder means providing that selected access for all subfolders below the shared folder too. Preferably never give anyone sharing rights (unless strictly necessary), because that person can give others more rights than they themselves have. This causes you to lose overview of who can access the data. Custom groups Give Research Drive users access via personal access groups (Settings > Custom groups). Members in such a group all receive the same rights when added to a folder. The group owner is the only one who can add and remove access group members and see the members of the group. However, all access group names are visible for the entire Research Drive, so aptly name the groups according to the following format: SYNC_ProjectName_Accesslevel , e.g., \"SYNC_Brainlinks_edit\". If a new person needs access, they can be added to the relevant access group and automatically gains access to the same files/folders as the other group members. After you have made any changes in access groups, please update the access document . Individual users Add users to folders individually if they should not have the same permissions as the custom groups. This could for example be outside researchers . Please note that users of SURFdrive do not necessarily need a new Research Drive account, you can simply share the relevant files/folders with their Federated cloud ID . Students and other outside users Generally, when sharing data with students or outsiders, stick to the following guidelines: Share data only when the sharing serves a scientific goal Keep the amount of data shared to a minimum Pseudonymize or, if possible, anonymize data before sharing Students should sign a non-disclosure agreement and stick to the working guidelines for students Give students and outside users access via access links that allow Download/View/Upload (edit only if it concerns a separate (Students) folder). Make use of the password and end-date functions: students and outside users should not have access to the data after their internships / the agreement have/has ended and the password will give extra protection against non-authorized use. Alternatively, you could add the external users or students as new Research Drive users (Dashboard > Add user), although for large amounts of users, this is not recommended. 3. Uploading data to Research Drive Rclone Rclone is a command-line tool to upload data to any location. It can run easily in the background and is relatively simple. Setting up Download rclone: https://rclone.org/downloads/ (no admin rights needed) Once downloaded, open your Command prompt (search for cmd ) Your command prompt shows a drive which it uses, e.g., P:/ . Move the unwrapped rclone files (at least rclone.exe ) to that drive. In your command prompt, type rclone config In your Research Drive account, create a new WebDAV password: Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords. Create a new password by filling in a name, e.g., \u201cRclone\u201d. Copy the password that was just created to a temporary file/your clipboard. Follow the instructions listed here . Use the following link for step 3: https://eur.data.surfsara.nl/remote.php/nonshib-webdav/ . Your username is yourERNAid@eur.nl and the password is the WebDAV password you just created (you will probably not see the password being pasted, but it is!). When you are asked for a bearer token , just press Enter Example summary of the config: Uploading data with Rclone Upload files from your command window (type cmd in your search bar if you don't know where it is), using the following general format: rclone copy [flags] \"source\" RD:\"destination\" Example command rclone copy -v -P --ignore-existing \u201cJ:\\ResearchData\\FSW\\Brain and Development - Projects\\2018_Brainlinks\\Ouderstudie\\\u201d RD:\u201c2018_Brainlinks (Projectfolder)/Brainlinks_Parentstudy\u201d copy the source contents to the destination folder print progress continuously ( -v and -P ) skip already existing files ( --ignore-existing ) Other Rclone commands List the files in the specified folder: rclone ls RD:\u201c2016_Zelfbeeld (Projectfolder)/Zelfbeeld_Data/Zelfbeeld_ProcessedData/\u201d Show configuration details: rclone config show Edit the configuration details: rclone config e More information on Rclone On the Research Drive wiki Flags to add to commands Rclone alternative: Cyberduck Cyberduck is a graphical user interface for uploading data. It also has built-in encryption software (cryptomator), which allows simultaneously encrypting and uploading data. Setting up Download and install Cyberduck (the program is free, select $0 of donation) - you do need admin access for this tool. Read the wiki page of SURF Research Drive and from there download the Research Drive cyberduck profile . Save the Research Drive cyberduck profile in the \u201cProfiles\u201d folder within your Cyberduck program files folder (e.g., \u201cC:\\Program Files\\Cyberduck\\profiles\u201d) In your Research Drive account, create a WebDAV password: Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords. Create a new password by filling in a name, e.g., \u201cCyberduck\u201d. Copy the password that was just created to a temporary file/your clipboard. (Re)Start Cyberduck Click \u201cNew connection\u201d (Nieuwe verbinding). In the pop-up window that appears, select the SURF Research Drive profile, change the server to eur.data.surfsara.nl and fill out your username (ERNA ID) and the WebDAV password that you just created. Do not forget to select \u201c Save password \u201d (Bewaar wachtwoord)! Then, select \u201cConnect\u201d (Verbind). After having made the connection, you should be able to navigate your (project) folders like in Research Drive. Every time Cyberduck restarts, this connection will be made, except when you explicitly disconnect (then you have to re-connect again). Uploading data in Cyberduck Turn on Checksum (Edit > Preferences > Wachtrij (Queue) > Checksum) Select a folder in which you want to upload files Click Upload and select the files to be uploaded. Once your files have been uploaded, they should appear in your Research Drive! 4. Uploading sensitive data to Research Drive Encryption Research Drive cannot contain special types of personal data (bijzondere persoonsgegevens). These comprise of: Race, ethnicity, political views, religion Sexual life/preferences Genetic or biometric data with the purpose of unique identification Health information, among which medical data (MRI data!) Criminal past Therefore, the following data need to be encrypted before uploading to Research Drive: Participant databases with contact information - using a password on Microsoft Office documents is sufficient MRI checklist information files (\u201cBijzonderhedenbestand\u201d) containing information about past surgeries and other health information - using a password on Microsoft Office documents is sufficient Files containing demographic data, responses about race, political views, religion, sexual life, criminal past and other potential health information. This type of file can be stored on Research Drive without encryption only when they are pseudonymized / not directly traceable to individuals. Raw, non-defaced MRI images In general, it is best to avoid having to use encryption , because passwords can be lost and software can deprecate. Data are much more durable if they can instead be anonymized or pseudonymized. For example, upload defaced MRI data and anonymized/pseudonymized health information to avoid having to encrypt them. How to encrypt? Keep it local : don't upload them to Research Drive. If this means you may lose data, don't do this Passwords : put a password on a Microsoft Office document (e.g., Excel, Word) and keep the password at a safe location . If you lose the password, the data is not accessible anymore Use encryption software : we use Cryptomator to encrypt non-defaced MRI data. Using Cryptomator to encrypt data Use Cryptomator when you want to encrypt folders containing multiple sensitive files before uploading that folder to Research Drive: Download and install the most recent version of Cryptomator Create an encrypted folder (vault) . Be sure to create both a password and a recovery key that can be used in case the password gets lost. Save both at a safe location ! If you lose them, you cannot access the data anymore. Open (decrypt) the vault . In Cryptomator, select a Vault and click \"Open vault\". Select the cryptomator masterkey file. You will be prompted to fill out the password and afterwards, the folder will open. Note that you need the Cryptomator software to see the files in a normal way. In your file explorer, you will probably only see nonsense files in a folder called 'd'. Work with vault contents : after opening a vault, the decrypted files will appear in a separate path on your computer (e.g., \"Z://\"). You can simply copy the path to tools (Matlab, R) or open files from here to work with them. After usage, remember to lock the vault again. Uploading encrypted folders with rclone works the same way as uploading regular folders! Encryption within Cyberduck Cyberduck has in-built functionality to encrypt files using Cryptomator : In Cyberduck, select the folder in which you want to create the encrypted folder Right click and select \u201cNew locked vault\u201d (Nieuwe versleutelde safe) Give the vault a name (remember to put the Project name in there, e.g., \u201cBrainlinks_Neural_data_raw\u201d) and a password. Store the password somewhere safe immediately. You can now upload folders into this encrypted folder as with normal folders. In the background, Cyberduck will decrypt your encrypted folders automatically (because it knows the password), which is why it looks no different than a normal folder in the Cyberduck environment. Saving and sharing passwords A few safe options are: Lastpass stores your passwords in a vault in the cloud (behind 1 master password). It can also store secure notes (such as Cryptomator recovery keys) and allows sharing passwords with others (premium version: Network center > Share item). Network drive : make sure that the drive is secured, backed up and only accessible to those who are allowed to decrypt the data Locally : keep in mind that when your PC is hacked, hackers may have access to the passwords and when your PC / drive crashes, the passwords may be lost. You can share passwords via SURFfilesender : per password and recovery key, create a txt file. Send it/them via SURF filesender and make sure a password is required to download the file(s). Send the password to download to files to the receiver(s) via another way (e.g., text or slack message). 5. Working with data: editing and analysis Editing documents The easiest way to edit documents is in your internet browser, because it allows collaborative editing (with OnlyOffice) and changes are automatically saved. If you mount Research Drive to your file explorer and then edit the document at the same time someone else does, there can be merging conflicts and the version with the last edit \u201cwins\u201d. Mounting Research Drive to your file explorer You can mount your Research Drive account to your file explorer, so that the Research Drive files can be accessed on your local PC. Note that collaborative editing is not possible this way, and merging conflicts may emerge when multiple people are working on the same files. OwnCloud is the recommended tool that is useful for working with small and few files. However, it is not suitable for synchronizing large (numbers of) files . Download the OwnCloud via this link or in Research Drive, go Settings. Scroll all the way down until you see something like this. Click on \"Desktop app\": Choose the installation location wisely: if you are going to work with large amounts of data, install Owncloud on a hard disk with sufficient storage space. See the Research Drive wiki page for how to configure OwnCloud Use the link eur.data.surfsara.nl to connect with and authorize the share by logging in to your Research Drive account Choose Selective synchronization and select only the folders you need to work on from your local machine. All synced files are stored and synced on your local machine. If your Research Drive storage is really high, you should not sync them all with your PC! Alternatively, choose Virtual file support , which makes sure that only files that are being worked on are downloaded To work with encrypted folders: synchronize the encrypted folder to your PC (somewhere with enough disk space) - this will probably take some time depending on the size of the folder open Cryptomator and select Open vault open the cryptomator masterkey file and fill out the password you should now be able to see your files and work with them. Bonus: your work will be automatically synchronized with Research Drive as long as you work in the synchronized folder Analyzing data from Research Drive There are multiple ways that you can analyze data that are stored on Research Drive: Use OwnCloud and run analyses on data that are stored in Research Drive as if the data were stored on your local PC. Advantage: cloud synchronization Disadvantage: requires sufficient disk space, synchronization may take a long time Use a cloud computing service , such as Jupyter Hub (built into Research Drive) or the LISA cluster Advantage: no local copies needed, fast analysis Disadvantage: mostly meant for large data analysis, may take some getting used to Locally : download the data to your local PC and analyze them there Advantage: no dependencies on your internet connection Disadvantage: not great for a lot of data, no cloud synchronization, requires manual upload to Research Drive afterwards Working with MRI data: recommended method Deface the MRI data before uploading them to Research Drive. If this is not possible (anymore), encrypt the folder that contains the relevant data as high as possible in the hierarchy, so that you only have to decrypt one folder for analyses. When installing Owncloud, choose a location with sufficient disk space (e.g., an external hard disk) Synchronize only the folder(s) that you need on your local PC via OwnCloud: your PC needs to have enough disk memory to save the data, also after processing! Note that syncing may take a while. After synchronizing, if needed, use Cryptomator to decrypt the folder (enter the password) The folder is now shown as a separate directory on your local PC (e.g., \"Z:\"). You can add this directory in SPM or Matlab for your analysis.","title":"How to"},{"location":"data-management/research-drive-how.html#research-drive-protocol","text":"This page contains information on how we deal with data on the SURF Research Drive in the SYNC lab, which can be accessed by logging in here .","title":"Research Drive protocol"},{"location":"data-management/research-drive-how.html#1-folders","text":"A project folder (at the root of the Research Drive) has to be created by the contract administrator (currently: Mark).

This is invisible to original sharer (data steward). However, the contents of the folder remain the same and visible to all. Interface When you log into Research Drive, you will automatically see an overview of Projects / folders of which you are data steward or member. These files can be accessed in the Menu in the upper left corner, as are Applications and the Dashboard: Dashboard The Dashboard is accessible to anyone, but only relevant data will be shown. Users can only invite new users. Under \"User accounts\", click \"Invite user\". For each user, you can view their Project membership, contract details, storage overview and service overview (available apps can be added here too). After account removal, the account will exist for 30 days. Data stewards can invite new users and additionally have an overview of project folders and user accounts Contract administrators can invite new users and have overview of project folders, but they can also add new and edit existing project folders and see the contract details.

Git is a version control system: it tracks the history as you change files. More specifically, it tracks who made which changes and when. It allows reverting files to a previous state. Note that it is possible to work on git projects locally without ever using github. Github is a platform that you can use to collaborate on projects that use git. It additionally allows for threaded discussions (issues), pull requests (see below) and several great apps. Please note that there are also other platforms that work similarly, such as GitLab , BitBucket or SourceFourge . Git and Github are most suitable for working with relatively small files . While originally used for code/software, you can use it for other types of small files as well, such as documentation. Why should I use git(hub)? Git is used a lot all over the globe and is free to download and use via several interfaces You will always be able to revert your errors - or those of someone else You can report which version of the files you have used for which publication. Even better, github allows exporting a snapshot (version) of your github repository (folder with files) to Zenodo, meaning you can publish your version used and give it a citable DOI. Github also has several other great functions, such as making a website out of your repository (such as this lab wiki!) Installation Create a Github account Install git locally . If you don't want to use the command line, also download a GUI such as RStudio or GitKraken ) Note: if you want to work with git in the command line on Windows, I can highly recommend using the Ubuntu app (the Linux Subsystem for Windows, downloadable via the Windows store), which may cause fewer Windows-related errors. The git workflow When working on a git project (within a folder called a git repository ), you will always perform the following steps: Make changes to some file and save them like you normally would Stage the changes: select which files you want to make a snapshot of (this step is most explicit if you work in the command line) Commit the changes: make a snapshot of the changes made so far. A commit (snapshot) is always accompanied by a commit message explaining what changes were made Any commit gets a specific identifier that can be used to reverse (undo) the commit. Some stage- and commit-related commands Check which files are changed but not yet staged or committed: git status Stage a file (tip: use the tab to use autocompletion): git add filename Stage multiple files: git add filename1 filename2 filename3 Stage all unstaged files in the workspace: git add -A . Commit the change(s) you staged: git commit -m \"Change x and y to z\" Commit all (staged and unstaged) change(s) made in the workspace: git commit -a -m \"Change x and y and z\" Branches A git repository can exist in multiple \u201cversions\u201d which are called branches . There is always a \u201cmaster\u201d branch, which you should consider the clean branch. Besides that, you can create other branches that are meant to make your own changes, or try something different without dirtying the clean (master) version. After you have made changes in your own branch and you think they should be incorporated in the master branch, you can then merge your branch with the master branch. Some branch-related commands Check which branch you are working on now (and list which branches there are): git branch -v Change branches: git checkout branchname Create a new branch: git checkout -b newbranchname Workflow on github On Github, the workflow is a bit more extensive, because often you are collaborating and do not want others to just start editing the master branch right away. There are multiple methods to collaborate on a project, but we recommend the following, assuming that there is already a repository for the project and you want to contribute: On the repository page on Github, fork the repository: this creates a copy of the repository on your own Github account that you have full access to. In your forked (copied) Github repository, create a new branch for the changes you are about to make with a short but comprehensible name, e.g. \u201cdorienchanges\u201d. If you want to edit files locally, clone your repository to your local PC, creating a folder in your file explorer (the contents of which can change according to which branch you are on!). Via the command line: git clone https://github.com/UserName/RepositoryName.git Via Rstudio, see this link Edit the files you want to edit and commit the changes (making a snapshot; include a comprehensible commit message!) You have now committed changes locally, but they are not yet visible in your remote repository, i.e., the online github repository on your account. In order to get the commits you made locally to be visible online, you need to push them to your remote repository on Github. Via the command line, note that the repository on your account is usually called \"origin\": git push origin branchnameonwhichyouworked Via Rstudio, see this link Now the changes are visible in your own account, but not in the main repository. In order to get your changes into the main repository, you need to do a pull request on Github. This is a request to the owners of the original repository to merge your branch with (one of) theirs . Once merged by the owners, you are often prompted to remove your own branch (which is not necessary if you are planning to make more changes later). Keeping your local copy (clone) up to date If you are working on a project with many collaborators making changes, the odds are that your own fork (online copy) and/or clone (local copy) are becoming out-of-date quite fast. Therefore, it is recommended to update those copies each time before you start making changes yourself, so you are working on the most recent versions of the files. In your clone (offline), you can set up the owner\u2019s repository as the \"upstream\" repository and then pull all commits from the upstream repository to your local PC Setting up the original repository as the upstream: git remote add upstream https://github.com/ownername/repositoryname.git Pulling changes from the upstream repository: git pull upstream branchname See this page when you use RStudio To update your online version of the repository, simply push the changes (e.g., push origin master after pulling from the upstream Resources For every piece of software, remember that google is your best friend .

Sharing data is becoming the golden standard in science. It enables others to reproduce your results and prevent fraud and honest mistakes in data analysis. Moreover, it enables reuse of your data in new analyses, increasing the impact of your work. Short guide: When to share what data? If data are completely anonymous , you can share them publicly in a dedicated repository, see step 1 or 2 If data cannot be completely anonymized, they are personal. You need a legal basis to share these data: Informed consent : what you can do with the data depends on the contents of the consent form. If participants consented to public data sharing and their data are not very sensitive (e.g., not from children or clinical groups), publish them in a repository or datapaper . If participants consented to sharing with restrictions, use a repository that allows access restrictions or use a data use agreement to share data case by case. If participants did not consent to any personal data sharing, share characteristics or aggregated data . Public interest : In theory, most research is publicly funded, and therefore we should be able to use this as legal basis for data sharing. However, it is still unclear when we are allowed to use it. The minimal prerequities are: the personal data sharing should rely on the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency informed consent was impossible to obtain, e.g., because the study took place a long time ago and consent cannot be obtained retroactively. Participants not consenting to data sharing is not a valid reason! When sharing personal data using the Public interest basis, you are encouraged to share data with access restrictions, especially if your data are sensitive or highly identifiable (e.g., data from minors or clinical groups, special categories of sensitive data, etc.) If you share data with a similar purpose as the original research project (such as for collaborating with other researchers on a related topic), a data use agreement suffices (not strictly necessary for EUR collaborators as they are from the same institution). Such agreement should lay out the conditions of storing, sharing and publishing the data. This falls under the scope of processing that is \"compatible with the original purpose\", which does not require a new/separate legal basis (GDPR Articles 5(1)(b) , 6(4) and 89(1) ). Ways of sharing data Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways: 1. Publish in a data repository For example (or find one here ): The EUR Data Repository : for publication packages at the EUR All data and materials accompanying a publication Only suitable for anonymous data See the publication packages page for more information. DANS DataverseNL : for publication packages at Leiden University ( instructions ) All data and materials accompanying a publication Not suitable for large or publication-independent datasets (max zip file size 10GB) or non-anonymous data Only accessibly via institutes that use DataverseNL DANS EASY (Dutch) For data and materials, not necessarily accompanying a publication Has deals with the university but still some limitations to the size of the data (max. 100 GB) Is aimed more at archiving than sharing data Also has a dark archive for non-anonymous data 4TU Research data International data repository for science, engineering and design Enables open or restricted access, private links, embargoes or even metadata-only records Up to 1 TB of storage for affiliated researchers, 10 GB for non-affiliated researchers Open Science Framework max 5 GB for private, 50 GB for public projects Choose storage location in EU: Germany Keep your data close to all other relevant files in your OSF project OSF is more aimed at project management than dissemination Other general-purpose repositories, such as: Zenodo (free up to 50GB) Dryad (not free) Non-EUR Figshare (free, max 20GB private space and 5GB per file) In all cases, make your data FAIR and take privacy considerations into account. 2. Publish a datapaper In a datapaper, you describe the data and the methods of collecting them, without the need to analyze them. This will get you a publication out of your data, irrespective of whether or not you publish results. This often requires that you make all described data public, because the aim of such publications is to provide access to high quality datasets and to facilitate reuse. Also, most journals have some policy in which repository you should deposit the data accompanying the datapaper. Note that a datapaper will be peer-reviewed just as well as a regular article. See this link for a list of data journals. 3. Share case-by-case For data that cannot be shared publicly, you can sometimes still share the data case-by-case. This can be the case: For MRI-data for which you have a legal basis to share them, but you may not want to publish publicly because of the sensitivity. For this type of data, you may want to consider using a data use agreement as well For data that has not been published about For data that does not belong to a publication, data that is too large to share in another way or some other reason Please note that this is only a FAIR solution if your metadata and access options are publicly findable and available (e.g., consider creating a metadata-only record in a repository). 4. Share only characteristics of the data If you do not want to or you can't share any real data, you can still make your data valuable: Aggregated data If your data are privacy-sensitive and you cannot share them, you can still share aggregated data, for example: Share first- and second level MRI data in NeuroVault . You can also link this to your manuscript (and the other way around). NeuroVault allowes meta-analyses of fMRI studies, making it worthwhile to share your group MRI data there. See the NeuroVault page for more information Share summary details of your data, such as averages and variation measures. Or make a shinyapp that allows exploring the data without accessing it! Synthetic data Creating a synthetic dataset can be useful to capture the statistical idiosyncrasies of your real dataset. This synthetic dataset can be used to reproduce the results of your analysis, without violating any privacy or intellectual property regulations. Read more: Review of synthetic generation methods synthpop : an R package for creating synthetic data ( paper , blog how to ) For MRI-data, see brainpower . Federated learning Federated learning arises from the field of Artificial Intelligence and relies \u201con the principle of remote execution\u2014that is, distributing copies of a machine learning algorithm to the sites or devices where the data is kept (nodes), performing training iterations locally, and returning the results of the computation (for example, updated neural network weights) to a central repository to update the main algorithm.\u201d ( Kaissis et al., 2020). This means that you do not move your data, while still providing valuable information about it. Some federated learning tools and projects: COINSTAC PySyft ENIGMA consortium: Consortium with several working groups. Share pre- and post-processing analysis scripts, the leading site will conduct meta-analysis OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics): collaborative to bring out the value of health data through large-scale analytics Personal Health Train , part of Health-RI (official website here ) Licensing data With licenses , you specify what others are permitted to do with your product. You can see it as some kind of agreement: if someone violates the license, you have the right to sue them, just like a regular lawful agreement. For anonymous data, it is recommended to choose a CC0 (public domain) or CC-BY 4.0 license. These open licenses both allow others to use the data without restrictions. For non-anonymous data, use a more restrictive license (but please don't use non-derivate (ND) or non-commercial (NC) licenses, read why here ) or formulate your own terms of use, for example in a data use agreement .

This falls under the scope of processing that is \"compatible with the original purpose\", which does not require a new/separate legal basis (GDPR Articles 5(1)(b) , 6(4) and 89(1) ).","title":"Short guide: When to share what data?"},{"location":"open-science/data-sharing-how.html#ways-of-sharing-data","text":"Publishing data can go roughly in the following ways:","title":"Ways of sharing data"},{"location":"open-science/data-sharing-how.html#licensing-data","text":"With licenses , you specify what others are permitted to do with your product.

A data sharing agreement can be set up between the owner of research data and someone with whom data is shared or who will process the data further. Important components of a data sharing agreement are who remains responsible in which role (i.e., are parties joint controllers or independent controllers of the data), about the use of the data (e.g., for scientific purposes) the use of intellectual property (if any) and confidentiality (incl. privacy-sensitive data). Using a data sharing agreement to share data leaves a high degree of control for the data owner concerning who has access to the data. However, please note that doing so can slow the process of data sharing tremendously . Therefore, always first consider whether there are more efficient ways of data sharing, e.g., using a data repository that has access restriction options. When to use a data sharing agreement? When the data cannot be made entirely anonymous and you want to take additional measures to protect data subjects' privacy AND When the data subject has given explicit informed consent to share their personal data with such parties OR you have confirmation that you can use a different legal basis to share personal data When data can be made entirely anonymous, you do not strictly need a data sharing agreement, except when the data include intellectual property rights. When the participant has NOT given explicit informed consent to share their personal data (non-anonymous data) and there is no other legal basis you can use, you are not allowed to share the data at all . Try to find a way to anonymize the data or do not share the data at all. How to make use of a data sharing agreement? Consider whether you really need to use an agreement to share your data. For example, it is not necessary when the data is not confidential, the data does not include intellectual property rights, or if you want to share with researchers within the same university. If you do need an agreement, try to make use of a template. The template that we can use at EUR (if sharing EUR-data) can be downloaded here . Another possible template from the Open Brain Consent can be found here . Edit the template to fit your specific situation. Send the agreement to erslegal [at] eur [dot] nl.

Whether you can share your research data with others depends on: 1. The anonymity of your data 2. Who owns your data 3. The infrastructure available to share the data In this chapter, we will go into nr. 1 and talk about the EU privacy law: the General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR Since May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming [AVG]) has been in place to better protect personal data. The most important aspects of the GDPR are: Privacy by Design : build privacy-increasing measures into your study design Privacy by Default : make sure your default settings already improve your participants' privacy Data minimization : Only collect and use personal data necessary for your research goal Legal basis : Make sure there is a legal basis (6 possible) to process (and share) the personal data you collect (e.g., informed consent or public interest more info (Dutch) DPIA : Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment whenever you collect (highly) sensitive data, such as names, addresses, race or health data. Inform participants about the goal of the personal data collection and which data you collect. What is personal data? Data is personal when you can identify someone by it, either directly (e.g., name, address) or indirectly (e.g., height, job, income, education). Indirect indicators are personal data if they can identify someone: when it concerns an extreme case (e.g., someone 2.20m tall) when combining data so that they can only be applicable to one person (NB. this can also concern publicly available data) when re-identification is still possible (e.g., with a name-number key conversion file) By law, data is considered identifiable when identification can occur with reasonable (proportionate) effort. Thus, it is not about the hypothetical possibility that data can be linked or combined. Because not everyone has access to the same data, the definition of \"identifiable\" may differ per situation. Important types of data Pseudonymous data: Data that is only identifiable with a key (that still exists). This is the case when after encryption, it is still possible to identify someone, e.g., because the key or the source data still exist. Pseudonymous data are still considered personal data , because the encryption is reversible , thus requiring a legal basis for processing. Special personal data: special sensitive categories of personal data that may be difficult to anonymize, they require additional measures: race of ethnic descent political views religion union membership genetic or biometric data aimed at unique identification health data sexual life and preference criminal records in the Netherlands: burgerservicenummer (BSN) Anonymous data: Data that are not (re)identifiable anymore: neiher by a name-number key, nor by combining with other publicly available data. Anonymous data are not considered personal data , so processing and sharing this kind of data do not require a legal basis. Sharing data under the GDPR Anonymous data can be shared without restriction if they are really anonymous. You may share non-anonymous data only when: You have attained explicit informed consent from the participant to do so (most used legal basis). For special personal data, this consent should be very explicit (\"I agree to share x, y and z\" with A, B and C): there cannot be any doubt about this. See some example sentences and a GDPR version of the Open Brain Consent initiative You reduce the amount of personal data shared to a minimum (data minimization principle) You take the necessary measures to protect your participants' privacy Always write a Data Management Plan (DMP) and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before starting a project with personal data When sharing data with researchers outside of the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland (no GDPR present), make sure that country has an adequacy decision . If the country does not have one, you need to take extra protection measures, such as standard contractual clauses or agreements. In case your data are not anonymous, but you have attained consent and still want to protect your participants' privacy better, you may always use a data sharing agreement . This document contains what users can and cannot do with your data, for how long and if you will get credit if the user publishes about your data. A good example is the agreement used by the Donders repository . The Open Brain Consent initiative is also working on a template agreement , or find an example template in the template chapter . Anonymizing data General tips Remove identifiers (name, address) Replace identifiers (e.g., date of birth by age or age groups) Use pseudonyms (e.g., participant numbers) Randomize the pseudonyms (participant numbers) Use only the middle range of the data: extreme cases may lead to identification because by definition, there are only few of them Remove the name-participant number key Plan how to anonymize the data up front and keep a log of your procedures Store original data in a safe location Determine whether different measures combined could lead to identification. If needed, consult a privacy officer. Deidentifying MRI-data There is some debate as to whether or not MRI data can be anonymized. One paper, for example, found that brain morphology, although preprocessed, was personally identifiable ( Takao, Hayashi, & Ohtomo, 2015 ). Moreover, it could be argued that, when combining multiple databases, the data may be identifiable in that way as well. Therefore, we do not speak of anonymizing MRI-data, but deidentifying it: MRI-data will always remain pseudonymous at best and therefore require a legal basis before sharing. Anonymize the filenames: replace names with codes Remove the header information (when using hdr and img files, not for nifti files) Deface the MRI-scans if your software does not do that automatically already. We recommend using pydeface . If you are uncertain whether your data are anonymous, please don't hesitate to contact a privacy officer. Have a look at this MRI data sharing guide for more info!

Inclusive research samples Description Although we have made some steps to diversify our research samples, we recognize that we still have much to learn and improve. Therefore, we want to make an effort to make our samples more diverse and representative of the whole population. For this purpose, we will (1) pay more attention to two facets of diversity, namely educational background and ethnic-cultural background and (2) align our recruitment strategy accordingly \u2013 choosing the appropriate channels to reach a diverse group of participants and minimize issues that may prevent certain sub-groups from participating. SMART goals For each future research project, we aim to have at least 30% of our participants who go to a vmbo-school or mbo-school (depending on the targeted age group). In the Netherlands almost 50% of the secondary school students are enrolled in a vmbo education . For each future research project, we aim to have at least 20% of our participants who have a migration background or who identify with other ethnicities besides Dutch. According to recent findings 27% of the Dutch youth has a migration background, in Rotterdam this is even 60% 2. Inclusive education and work environment Description Another essential aspect of our work and responsibility involves education \u2013 whether it pertains to teaching our knowledge and skills to university students or to society more broadly, in the form of outreach or policy recommendations. We need to consider how to be more inclusive and supportive in the opportunities we provide to a wide arrange of students, what the most appropriate channels are for sharing our findings to reach all of society, and how we can make sure that policy recommendations do not exclude important sub-groups of our population. We are developing SMART rules to get there. SMART goals For each future research project, we aim to reach out to at least vmbo schools, ideally in a non-textual way (e.g., via a vlog, information video or in person meeting). Depending on the targeted age group this could also be mbo-schools. As from the new academic year onwards (i.e. September, 2020) we aim to broaden our internship possibilities, by offering at least two internships to non-university students . We want to reach out to at least two youth workers and two secondary (i.e. vmbo/havo/vwo) and/or mbo-schools to inform them about our internship and youth panel possibilities. 3. Include all voices Description In all (the stages of) our activities, we need to hear other voices, to help us expand our view and understand what is important for all of society. That is the ultimate way to truly get society, youth and neuroscience connected. SMART goals We aim to have yearly diverse youth panels in which we can discuss our research and how we can improve it. As from the new academic year onwards (i.e. September, 2020) we aim to pop-up, in terms of a living lab, in a diverse community within Rotterdam city where we can come together as a lab and work there once a week for at least three months . We aim to have yearly focus group meetings on diversity and inclusion in which representative individuals from society can join. At the beginning of the new academic year (i.e. September, 2020) we aim to reach out in a non-textual way (via a vlog, person-meetings or event) to the community in which our living lab will be located, in order to increase our visibility as a lab, introduce our work and science in general, and to stimulate co-creation. Evaluation of SMART goals Every two months we aim to schedule a meeting in which we can discuss the progress of our SMART goals. Some of the goals are more long-term goals and depend for instance on new projects being started. Other goals can be accomplished in the more near future. We think it is important that we realize that all these goals are a process in itself and that we will learn along the way. This could mean that we might change and adapt our goals according to new experiences and new knowledge.","title":"Our goals for inclusive science"},{"location":"open-science/inclusivity-goals.html#diversity-inclusion-at-the-sync-lab-smart-goals","text":"","title":"Diversity &amp; inclusion at the SYNC lab: SMART goals"},{"location":"open-science/inclusivity-goals.html#smart-specific-measurable-achievable-realistic-timely","text":"Open Science also means inclusive science, and we formulated the following goals in July 2020 (Descriptions copied from our blogpost ):","title":"(SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timely)"},{"location":"open-science/inclusivity-goals.html#1-inclusive-research-samples","text":"Description Although we have made some steps to diversify our research samples, we recognize that we still have much to learn and improve.

APCs can sometimes be reimbursed because of Big Deals made between publishers and university libraries. According to Plan S, the open access journals have to fulfill several requirements that you can find here \". Green route (self-archiving): publish a version of your article in an institutional repository ( RePub for the EUR) after publishing it via a journal.

Preprints A preprint is the submitted, non-peer reviewed version of your article. An increasing number of researchers publish preprints in Preprint servers in order to get their results out there quicker. Read more below and in this preprint FAQ . Why publish preprints? Speed : Preprints are almost immediately publicly visible, besides some checks on content and ethics Visibility : Because preprints are open access and many preprint servers are indexed by search engines (e.g., Google Scholar), you can reach more people with your work Feedback : Some preprint servers allow collecting feedback on preprints, which can make your work so much better Prevent scooping : preprints are timestamped, so by posting it, you have established precedence Individual gain : such as showing productivity, openness to feedback, etc. Where to publish preprints? Preferably a preprint server that provides a persistent identifier. For example: OSF Preprints : you can choose many preprint servers and can also share supplementary files. A list of preprint servers hosted via OSF Preprints can be found here . Directly via a preprint server, such as BioRxiv or PsyArXiv You can even add a preprint on ResearchGate ! Feedback and updating There are different ways researchers can give/receive feedback on preprints: - In OSF preprints, you can use their tool Hypothes.is to annotate preprints, see their help guide - Some servers offer comment functionalities (e.g., when logged in) - Use (academic) twitter What you do with feedback is completely up to you. If you want, you can update your preprint to a new version. However, note that all versions are timestamped and retained . Often new versions get a new identifier (DOI) and old versions cannot be removed!

The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.\u201d - Buckheit & Donoho, 1995 (read the full article here ) This quote nicely summarizes the importance of sharing data, methods and code so that others can evaluate the actual work that was done in a research paper. Luckily, web-based technologies make it very easy to share these materials (and even to share the complete software environment using Docker and Singularity containers). However, just releasing your code without annotation is not very informative because others (and future you!) can't make a lot of sense of it. Two helpful tools to annotate your code are RMarkdown and Jupyter notebooks. How do tools like R Markdown and Jupyter notebooks make research more reproducible? R Markdown files and Jupyter notebooks contain 1) the code that others need to reproduce your work along with 2) the narration that a reader needs to understand your work R and Python code can be run within these documents, meaning that in principle others can check whether your work is reproducible R Markdown Especially when you do your data analysis in R / RStudio, R Markdown is a very useful tool to put your text and analysis together in one place. It is basically R + Markdown (a markup language to format text). It can be used to write a whole paper, including code to generate figures. This code can be outputted in many formats such as html, pdf and Word. For full documentation see also the R Markdown documentation and this neat cheatsheet (pdf) . Example of RMarkdown chunk in RStudio with associated html output (from RMarkdown docs) Installing R Markdown have R and RStudio installed (avalaible for free) install R Markdown install.packages(\"rmarkdown\") Reference lists using Zotero in R Markdown When writing papers, it is also very useful to connect RStudio with Zotero. Zotero is a free and open source reference manager with a very handy browser plugin . If you have never used a reference manager before: it is a great way to keep a library of all your literature (including pdf's) together and will help you to cite papers in the right way and produce automatic reference lists in the right format for you. This can be done in a word processor like Microsoft Word, but also in R Markdown. The basic steps you need to make this work: install Zotero and import references (e.g., using the browser plugin) install the Better BibTex plugin for Zotero by clicking Tools > Add-ons within Zotero and follow these instructions install the citr R package Now when writing text in an RMarkdown file in RStudio: within RStudio in the toolbar click Addins > Insert citations here you can search through your references and select the ones you want to enter you should also edit the YAML header (the upper part of the Rmd file with title, author, output et cetera): here the bibtex file (eg: bibliography: references.bib ) should be listed; if you also add # References at the end of the main text, your bibliography will be created automatically there the format of the bibliography can be defined by pointing to a csl file in the YAML header (e.g, csl: ./apa.csl ). All csl (citation style language) files can be downloaded from the internet, see also https://citationstyles.org/ Jupyter notebooks For analyses that are conducted using Python, Jupyter notebooks are a great way to keep executable code and annotation in one place (note that many other programming languages are also supported by Jupyter notebooks: the name is reference to the 3 core languages Julia, Python, and R). For full documentation see the Jupyter Notebook docs and https://jupyter.org/ for more information about the larger Project Jupyter ecosystem.

In an OSF project, you can: - Register a preregistration - Register a preprint - Store and share project documentation - Link external services, such as git(hub) repositories, publication packages, Research Drive (owncloud) folders, etc. - ... and much more, such as obtaining Open science badges! . See this link for more information on the functionality of OSF and the OSF guides for many FAQs and technical documentation. Recommended use of the OSF We recommend using the OSF as a central place for your project, especially if you will produce multiple publications in a project. Link your OSF project to the SYNC lab OSF page (Log in > Components > Link Projects). No worries, the SYNC lab collaborators cannot automatically edit your linked project! Register preregistrations (Registrations > New registration) and Preprints in the relevant components. If your preregistration concerns one manuscript, we recommend creating a separate component in which you link all relevant materials (publication package, preregistration, code, preprint if applicable, etc.) belonging to that manuscript. A project can contain multiple Registrations and Preprints. Be sure to provide good metadata, preferably choose a CC BY 4.0 license and create a DOI so that your preregistration is citable. Data : you can link OSF with external storage (see below) or store data on the OSF itself (choose the German storage site). On the OSF itself, there is now a storage limit of 5 GB for private and 50 GB for public projects. If you store on OSF directly, please take privacy into account at all times Code and software : you can link OSF with a Github repository in case your preprocessing pipeline, processing steps or experimental files are stored there (see below). If your code is however not code-worthy, we recommend storing the code in the publication package or on OSF itself. Link your OSF profile to your ORCID account so that there cannot be any confusion as to who you are. Connecting the OSF to external services Via the Add-on tab, you can connect the OSF with several external services if OSF itself does not provide enough storage. Note that this will not store data on the OSF itself! SURF Research Drive (via Owncloud) Connecting with an Owncloud service like the Research Drive goes via a WebDAV connection. All changes made in the selected Research Drive folder will become visible in the OSF component, but the data are still stored at the EUR. Note that you can only make 1 Research Drive connection per OSF component (multiple connections per project are possible). Please note the following: Make sure the access level is read-only, unless you want your collaborators to be able to adjust the Research Drive contents Think about anonymity: if you make the project/component public, data that are shared have to be anonymous or consented by participants to share publicly Linking an Owncloud folder is not a FAIR solution: there is no curated metadata and no license. Also, the Research Drive is not meant to archive data after the project is finished, so this will always be a temporary solution. How to link a Research Drive folder to OSF Create a WebDAV password in Research Drive (Account > Settings > Security > WebDAV passwords). Copy the WebDAV password you created and click \"done\" Go to the component in your OSF project in which you want to add the Research Drive folder (if you are not in the right component, the Research Drive folder will be linked to the incorrect location) Select \u201cAdd-on\u201d to add the ownCloud Add-on in OSF Configure the add-on in OSF: URL: https://eur.data.surfsara.nl Username: erna-id@eur.nl Password: WebDAV password you just made Figshare or a publication package in the EDR You can link 1 publication package (1 Figshare link) per OSF component, so that the publication package appears in your OSF project. This way, you can license your data (not possible in OSF) and provide metadata but still link it to your OSF project for more context. Click here for a tutorial. Github repository If you stored code on Github (for re-use, think about licensing!), you can link your repository to an OSF component. Again, you can only link 1 repository per OSF component.

A preregistration is basically a time-stamped plan of your research before you have seen your research data (either before data collection or before data analysis), \"the introduction and methods sections of your paper\". It is a document containing at least: Your hypotheses Your methodology and variables (design, sample, stopping rule, exclusion criteria, procedure, variables, etc.) Your analysis plan to test the hypotheses (statistical tests, transformations, assumption tests, etc.) Inference criteria: when do you consider your hypothesis rejected or confirmed?

Afterwards, simply report the deviation in your manuscript!

See this link for an easy tutorial on how to preregister on the Open Science Framework (OSF). Don't forget to include your collaborators and to include the link to your preregistration in your manuscript. What are Registered Reports? Registered Reports are preregistrations that are peer reviewed by journals. This highly eliminates publication bias, because at Stage 1 peer review, no results are known yet, so manuscripts cannot be accepted or rejected basead on results. Below the process of Registered Reports is visualized: After your preregistration has received an In Principle Acceptance (Stage 1), you can start collecting data and writing up your results. Most journals that get through Stage 1 will also get accepted in Stage 2, because the study design has already been reviewed.

Approved ethics protocol How to upload a publication package? Log into the EUR data repository (EDR) (instance of Figshare) with your EUR credentials. Link your EDR profile to your ORCID. This will make sure that your publication package appears in your ORCID profile too. Under my data, create a new item. In this item, you can upload all publication package files (preferably without zipping), so that your files are linked under 1 DOI. Fill out as many fields in the form as possible, including all authors on your manuscript and links to external resources. This will make sure your data will be Findable. For license, preferably choose CC-BY 4.0, which enables maximum reuse of your data, besides being acknowledged for your data. If your manuscript is not accepted for publication yet, 1) Reserve a DOI that you can use in your publication, 2) Generate a private link for reviewers to see your data and 3) Save changes (do not Publish yet). Once your manuscript is accepted for publication and your data (analysis) will not change anymore, you can Publish it. After saving or publishing, your package will be looked at by a data curator from the EUR. They will contact you if they have any questions about your package or tips to improve it even more. More information on how to use the EUR data repository can be found in this Youtube playlist . Tips Be sure to create the publication package (reserve a DOI) before your manuscript is published, so that the manuscript links to the publication package and vice versa Prevent uploading files multiple times. If you have already uploaded data or code on OSF or Github, link those uploads to the publication package, instead of re-uploading in the publication package. If you have uploaded elsewhere (e.g., NeuroVault), provide a readme with the relevant links to make sure everything is findable! If applicable, create links with an OSF project, a Github repository and your ORCID, click here and here for how to do this. Only publish data as confidential when that is absolutely necessary. The reuse of your data is significantly reduced when they are behind a confidentiality wall. Moreover, when the owner of the publication package leaves the EUR, they cannot provide access to the confidential files anymore.

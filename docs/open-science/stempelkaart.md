# Open Science stamp card (stempelkaart)

In order to make all the different facets of Open Science easy to implement for our lab, we developed an Open Science stamp card. It provides oversight and resources for making your research as openly available as possible in four major phases of research:
<ul>
    <li>Preparation of the paper</li>
    <li>Conducting the study</li>
    <li>Writing the manuscript</li>
    <li>After publication</li>
</ul>

Each phase has its own steps that can be checked off, with some steps (in red) being labeled as ‘must-do’ (e.g., making a publication package). The other, nice-to-do, steps are those that are not required, but are in line with the vision of SYNC (e.g., uploading a preprint or writing a blog on your research).

Our Open Science core-team, with input from the entire lab, made the following template which can be downloaded [here](docs/img/sync_stempelkaart_202209.xlsm).

(Work in progress, special thanks to Dorien Huijser for helping with the setup.)
